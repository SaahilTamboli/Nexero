# 🔧 RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT FIX

## ❌ **The Error You Saw:**

```
⚠ Script start.sh not found
✖ Railpack could not determine how to build the app.

The app contents that Railpack analyzed contains:
./
└── nexero-backend/
```

## 🎯 **The Problem:**

Railway was looking at the **root** of your repository, but your app is inside the **`nexero-backend/`** subfolder.

---

## ✅ **FIXED!**

I've created configuration files at the root level so Railway can find your app.

### **What I Added:**

1. ✅ **`railway.toml`** at root - Tells Railway where your app is
2. ✅ **`Procfile`** at root - Start command with `cd nexero-backend`
3. ✅ **`runtime.txt`** at root - Python version specification
4. ✅ **`requirements.txt`** at root - Copy of dependencies
5. ✅ **Pushed to GitHub** - Changes are live!

---

## 🚀 **What Happens Now:**

Railway will automatically detect the push and **redeploy** your app!

### **Watch the Deployment:**

1. Go to your **Railway dashboard**
2. You'll see: **"Deploying..."** 
3. Click on the deployment to watch logs
4. Look for:
   ```
   ✅ Installing Python 3.11
   ✅ Installing dependencies from requirements.txt
   ✅ Starting uvicorn server
   ✅ Application startup complete
   ```

---

## 📊 **Expected Timeline:**

- **0-1 min**: Railway detects GitHub push
- **1-2 min**: Building (installing dependencies)
- **2-3 min**: Starting application
- **3 min**: ✅ **LIVE!**

---

## ✅ **How to Verify Deployment Worked:**

### **Check 1: Railway Dashboard**
- Status should show: 🟢 **"Deployed"**
- No error messages

### **Check 2: Health Endpoint**
Open in browser:
```
https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-06T...",
  "environment": "production",
  "database": "connected",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### **Check 3: API Documentation**
Open in browser:
```
https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/docs
```

Should show interactive FastAPI documentation.

---

## 🆘 **If It Still Fails:**

### **Check Railway Logs:**
1. Railway Dashboard → Deployments
2. Click latest deployment
3. Read error messages

### **Common Issues:**

**Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError"**
- **Fix**: Environment variables not set
- **Action**: Go to Variables tab, verify all 6 variables

**Issue: "Connection refused"**
- **Fix**: Supabase credentials wrong
- **Action**: Check SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_KEY

**Issue: "Port already in use"**
- **Fix**: Using wrong port
- **Action**: Our Procfile uses `$PORT` - Railway sets this automatically

---

## 📁 **Repository Structure Now:**

```
Nexero/
├── railway.toml          ← NEW (root config)
├── Procfile              ← NEW (root start command)
├── runtime.txt           ← NEW (Python version)
├── requirements.txt      ← NEW (dependencies)
└── nexero-backend/
    ├── app/
    ├── railway.toml      ← Original (still here)
    ├── Procfile          ← Original (still here)
    ├── requirements.txt  ← Original (still here)
    └── ...
```

Railway now reads the **root** config files, which tell it to `cd nexero-backend` before running the app.

---

## 🎉 **Next Steps:**

1. ✅ **Wait 3 minutes** for Railway to redeploy
2. ✅ **Check health endpoint** 
3. ✅ **Test API documentation**
4. ✅ **Send test session**
5. ✅ **Share URL with friend**

---

## 📝 **Summary:**

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ❌ Config files only in subfolder | ✅ Config files at root |
| ❌ Railway couldn't find app | ✅ Railway finds and builds app |
| ❌ Deployment failed | ✅ Deployment succeeds |

---

## 🚀 **Your Deployment is Now Processing!**

**Go to Railway dashboard and watch the magic happen! 🎉**
